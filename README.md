# Battle Ship

### Reflection
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process. <br />
> We created methods one at a time following the ideal user experience pattern playing the game in Iteration 3, and tested them at each interval. We created these methods and flow in a separate class of for the game. We quickly learned that having the inputs and outputs in their own class would be more beneficial and better uphold SRP, so we separated them into user interface and game flow classes.

3. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on? <br />
> We would spend more time on testing for our NewGame class. It was difficult to test output/input and part the reason we created a user interface class to handle the user inputs, but we still found it difficult to test after separating these. We would also work on removing a number of dependencies and limit use of global variables.

4. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project. <br />
> We mostly used the driver/navigator workflow. When it came to later sections of the project, we were able to split off and work separately more often while also leaning on each other for thought partnership.

5. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. <br />
> Since we worked together often and both prefer feedback in real-time, we actively gave feedback in the moment verbally or via slack/github. Often we would have a discussion about how we want to prioritize addressing any issues or concerns, whether it be now or after we finish our current objective.

# Battle Ship


1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
-We created a method pretraining to each section for Iteration 3 and tested them at each interval. We created these steps into a separate class of user iterations with the game.
We quickly learned that having the inputs and outputs in their own class would be beneficial, so we separated them into user interface and game handling classes.

3. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
-We would spend time testing our NewGame class. It was the whole reason we created a user interface class to handle the user inputs.
We would also work on removing dependencies on global variables.

4. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
-We used a lot of driver/navigator workflow. When it came to later sections of the project, we were able to split off and work separately more often while also leaning on each other for thought partnership.

5. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
-Since we worked together often, we would bring up feedback as we found it.
Often we would have a discussion about when we want to deal with the issue/concern, whether it be now or after we finish our current objective.
